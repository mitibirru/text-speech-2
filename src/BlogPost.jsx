Especially effective for people with visual or cognitive impairments or on the go. I came up with the idea to implement it for my blog, so this is how I started researching this topic which ended up being a tutorial for you. So in this tutorial, we will go through the process of building a text-to-speech component in React. We will use the `Web Speech API` to implement the text-to-speech functionality.";
